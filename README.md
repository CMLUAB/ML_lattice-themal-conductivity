# ML_lattice-themal-conductivity
# Description
This repository contains the Python code and ML data used in our study to search for materials with low lattice thermal conductivity.
# Data
The target.json file contains the final dataset for feature generation. The feature.csv file contains the final data set in our ML training. The data information includes 61 features.
# Codes
Once the feature.csv is ready, we can go into the code folder and build the ML model for the lattice thermal conductivity. Please go to each folder for details.
# Environment
- python 3.7
- sklearn 0.23.2
- matminer 0.7.8
