# Steps
1. List the compound names to predict in the "predict_list.csv" file.
2. In the PredictionExample.ipynb file, when loading the model, you can change the weighted model "FinalKLModelWeighted.joblib" to the un-weighted one "FinalKLModel.joblib" if you like.
3. Run the PredictionExample.ipynb code, and it will first generate the training features and then print out the predicted lattice thermal conductivity accordingly for all the compounds listed in "predict_list.csv".
